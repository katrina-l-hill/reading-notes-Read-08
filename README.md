Expressions and Operators:
-	An expression is any valid unit of code that produces a value when resolved.
-	For example, an expression can be a variable name that equals whatever value you assign to it. 
-	The value you assign to it can be anything from a number to a string, to a boolean.
-	Operators are symbols that used to assign values, perform operations (e.g., arithmetic) on operands. 

Loops:
-	Loops are used to perform repeated tasks based on a condition set by the developer.
-	Essentially, a loop will do an action x, y number of times. 
-	It will run until the defined condition is either false or true.
-	Common loops used in JavaScript are for and while loops.
-	A while loop means that while a set condition is not false or true, the loop run a particular code until it is false or true.
-	While loops return to the beginning of the expression when they’re done.
-	A for loop means that the code will repeat until a specified condition evaluates to false or true.
-	For loops move through the rest of the expression when it's done with the one it’s on.
-	In for loops, the developer sets the iteration count, as opposed to while loops which continue to run an indefinite number of times.
